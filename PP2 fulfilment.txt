level 1: neutral + sad
level 2: angry 
level 4: disgust + angry

level 3: nail biting
level 5: hair pulling

dataset eka hadagatta widiya me research ekata galapena widiyata

level 1: neutral + sad

level 2: angry             (+ level 1 dataset)

level 3: nail biting       (+ level 1, 2 dataset)

level 4: disgust + angry   (+ level 1, 2, 3 dataset)

level 5: hair pulling      (+ level 1, 2, 3, 4 dataset)


nail biting and hair pulling can be cause to stressed, anxiety or ptsd. 
both behaviours 

the previous error was this,

level 1: neutral + sad
level 2: angry             
level 3: nail biting       
level 4: disgust + angry   
level 5: hair pulling      

after talking with the external supervisor the solution he gave is this, 

level 1: neutral + sad
level 2: angry             (+ level 1 dataset)
level 3: nail biting       (+ level 1, 2 dataset)
level 4: disgust + angry   (+ level 1, 2, 3 dataset)
level 5: hair pulling      (+ level 1, 2, 3, 4 dataset)

like above combining the dataset we can get a good idea how this happens and doing this, output is more reliable. and also he suggest to combine blood pressure, BMI, heart rate and
 other physical health metrics for future work.

objective & solution

research problem is,
in present AI solutions are not good to use for mental disorder health section. find out AI solution can give a good solution for mental disorders.

solution is,
predict stress level of customers using AI based  mobile application after uploading a video footage. 


Model Explanation

a. dataset is consist of two parts. 
	1. facial recognition
		download from kaggle. (put this link in reference section.) 
	2. body movements
		download from pexels, istock websites (put this link in references section)
	with discussion with miss nimali I preprocess the dataset. 

b. model selection
	In my component I work with images so CNN is the best machine learning approach to work with. (put this link in reference section)

c. Result and Discussion
	put an image of epoches, learning rate, f1-score

d. challanges

	1. Data Privacy and Ethical Concerns
		real world true data use karanna bari una data ethical issues nisa.
